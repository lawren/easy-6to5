# Easy 6to5
Starter kit for quickly spinning up a project using Gulp, ES2015 (Babel), and SASS.

## Getting Started
To get up and running, simply `npm install` from within the project folder and then use `gulp` to begin watching for changes. Some empty files are setup for you in the `src` directory to help you get up and running faster.

## What's Included
- Local server deployment and browser launching
- Babel transpiling from ES6 to ES5
- Browserify
- SCSS processing
- Optional minification of SCSS and JS (enabled by default in `gulpfile.js`)
